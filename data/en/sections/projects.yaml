  summary: The project performs semantic segmentation on delicate, small fields using their satellite imagery. Various pixel-level time series classification models are implemented utilizing time series data from Sentinel satellites. Experiments are conducted to explore the transferability and adaptability of the models' trained weights across different locations and time periods.

- name: Time Series Forecasting of U.S. Candy Production
  logo: /images/sections/projects/Candy.png
  role: Time Series Course Project
  timeline: "Sep. 2023 - Nov. 2023"
  summary: The project focuses on forecasting the candy production in the U.S. based on the time series data over the past 45 years. Techniques such as Box-Cox transformation and differencing are applied to achieve stationarity and the optimal SARIMA model are identified using ACF/PACF analysis and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The model are further validated through comprehensive diagnostic tests and spectral analysis.
