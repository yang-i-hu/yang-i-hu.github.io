    responsibilities:
    - Scaled the RAG database for Unity’s AI assistant, Muse Chat, by developing a workflow that systematically gathers inputs from various Unity forums and enhances data quality with an LLM pipeline.
    - Created MuseBench, a system using LLM-as-a-judge along with a benchmark dataset to evaluate the AI agents, achieving a 95% reduction in time required for assessment processes while minimizing human labor.
    - Developed a pipeline with a locally deployed LLM to extract the key error messages from Unity Cloud Build log files that typically exceed 100k lines.
